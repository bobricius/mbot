# mbot

2D actuator move micro robot in X/Y 2D space
Less than 10$ educational platform with micro magnetic robot (mBot), 
only 6 GPIO to move in unlimited X/Y 2D space

Great for physical education for languages like Karel and make 
SKOBAN game or solve acrylic cutted labyrinth. 

My project not violating SRI international patent 
(maybe, I am not patent expert) 

There is differences: 

- I am using another moving track configutation 
- Control is 3-phase unipolar against 4-phase bipolar 
- My manipulator (mBot) use 4 magnets and not levitating 
- For move in one dimension I need only 3x Mosfets connected to any MCU 
(Arduino Atmega328, Stm32, MSP430, ESP XXXX) 
- 6 GPIO to move in X/Y 2D space 
- Moving board can be produced in any fab, it is just only PCB board 8/8mil 
- IT IS CHEAP
